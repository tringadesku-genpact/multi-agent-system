It aims to efficiently move food products from producers to consumers while ensuring food safety, traceability, and transparency throughout the process. Global food supply chains are noted for their enhanced food safety measures, advanced technology adoption, and sophisticated data management systems, which contribute to greater food security and economic growth compared to local food supply chains [1][3].\n\n### Examples\nAn example of a food supply chain can be seen in the confectionery industry, where blockchain technology is utilized to enhance safety and traceability. This technology allows for secure and transparent sharing of information across the supply chain, addressing challenges such as food safety and inefficiencies in traditional methods [2][3]. Additionally, local food supply chains often involve sourcing food from nearby farms, thereby reducing the number of intermediaries and fostering a direct relationship between producers and consumers [1].\n\n### Limitations\nDespite its advantages, the food supply chain faces several limitations. Traditional supply chain methods often struggle with transparency and real-time information sharing, leading to inefficiencies and risks in food safety [3]. Moreover, the complexity of managing perishable goods adds another layer of challenge, requiring advanced practices to align production with consumer demand effectively [4]. These limitations highlight the need for continuous improvement and innovation within food supply chain management.\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 6 | chunk 0\n[3] Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf | page 4 | chunk 1\n[4] A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf | page 2 | chunk 7\n[5] How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf | page 10 | chunk 0", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "summarize what is the food supply chain used for", "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "summarize what is the food supply chain used for", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 3, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.7134829759597778}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6879408359527588}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.6763288974761963}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6756665110588074}, {"citation": {"source_file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6747821569442749}], "retried": false}

It begins with farming, where agricultural tasks are performed to grow crops or raise livestock. Following this, the harvesting phase collects the produce, which is then processed to prepare it for distribution. The distribution stage involves transporting the food to various retail outlets, where it is eventually sold to consumers for consumption [1][6].\n\nIn addition to these primary stages, the food supply chain also incorporates various activities such as planning, sourcing, and logistics management to ensure efficiency and alignment with consumer demand. Advanced technologies and data management systems are increasingly being adopted to enhance traceability and food safety throughout the supply chain [2][6]. Local food supply chains, characterized by shorter distances between producers and consumers, typically involve fewer intermediaries, promoting a direct relationship between the two [1].\n\nChallenges within the food supply chain include maintaining transparency, ensuring food safety, and managing the complexities of delivering perishable goods. The integration of technologies such as blockchain is being explored to improve traceability and reduce inefficiencies, thereby addressing some of these challenges [6][8]. Overall, the food supply chain is a complex network that requires careful orchestration of its various components to function effectively.\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf | page 2 | chunk 7\n[3] How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf | page 10 | chunk 0\n[4] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 6 | chunk 0\n[5] Requirements for a food traceability system in a fruit supply chain.pdf | page 3 | chunk 7\n[6] Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf | page 4 | chunk 1\n[7] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 15 | chunk 4\n[8] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 7 | chunk 2\n[9] Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf | page 2 | chunk 5\n[10] Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf | page 2 | chunk 6", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "summarize the food supply chain process", "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "summarize the food supply chain process", "top_k": 10, "notes": 10}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 10, "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 4, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 10, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6834858655929565}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6758204698562622}, {"citation": {"source_file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6741740703582764}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6626628637313843}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Requirements for a food traceability system in a fruit supply chain.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6536556482315063}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.6520602107048035}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 15, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.6516047716140747}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 7, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6446987390518188}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 5}, "score": 0.6421931982040405}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 6}, "score": 0.641301155090332}], "retried": false}
