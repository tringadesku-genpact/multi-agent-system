It aims to efficiently move food products from producers to consumers while ensuring food safety, traceability, and transparency throughout the process. Global food supply chains are noted for their enhanced food safety measures, advanced technology adoption, and sophisticated data management systems, which contribute to greater food security and economic growth compared to local food supply chains [1][3].\n\n### Examples\nAn example of a food supply chain can be seen in the confectionery industry, where blockchain technology is utilized to enhance safety and traceability. This technology allows for secure and transparent sharing of information across the supply chain, addressing challenges such as food safety and inefficiencies in traditional methods [2][3]. Additionally, local food supply chains often involve sourcing food from nearby farms, thereby reducing the number of intermediaries and fostering a direct relationship between producers and consumers [1].\n\n### Limitations\nDespite its advantages, the food supply chain faces several limitations. Traditional supply chain methods often struggle with transparency and real-time information sharing, leading to inefficiencies and risks in food safety [3]. Moreover, the complexity of managing perishable goods adds another layer of challenge, requiring advanced practices to align production with consumer demand effectively [4]. These limitations highlight the need for continuous improvement and innovation within food supply chain management.\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 6 | chunk 0\n[3] Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf | page 4 | chunk 1\n[4] A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf | page 2 | chunk 7\n[5] How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf | page 10 | chunk 0", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "summarize what is the food supply chain used for", "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "summarize what is the food supply chain used for", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 3, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.7134829759597778}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6879408359527588}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.6763288974761963}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6756665110588074}, {"citation": {"source_file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6747821569442749}], "retried": false}

It begins with farming, where agricultural tasks are performed to grow crops or raise livestock. Following this, the harvesting phase collects the produce, which is then processed to prepare it for distribution. The distribution stage involves transporting the food to various retail outlets, where it is eventually sold to consumers for consumption [1][6].\n\nIn addition to these primary stages, the food supply chain also incorporates various activities such as planning, sourcing, and logistics management to ensure efficiency and alignment with consumer demand. Advanced technologies and data management systems are increasingly being adopted to enhance traceability and food safety throughout the supply chain [2][6]. Local food supply chains, characterized by shorter distances between producers and consumers, typically involve fewer intermediaries, promoting a direct relationship between the two [1].\n\nChallenges within the food supply chain include maintaining transparency, ensuring food safety, and managing the complexities of delivering perishable goods. The integration of technologies such as blockchain is being explored to improve traceability and reduce inefficiencies, thereby addressing some of these challenges [6][8]. Overall, the food supply chain is a complex network that requires careful orchestration of its various components to function effectively.\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf | page 2 | chunk 7\n[3] How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf | page 10 | chunk 0\n[4] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 6 | chunk 0\n[5] Requirements for a food traceability system in a fruit supply chain.pdf | page 3 | chunk 7\n[6] Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf | page 4 | chunk 1\n[7] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 15 | chunk 4\n[8] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 7 | chunk 2\n[9] Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf | page 2 | chunk 5\n[10] Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf | page 2 | chunk 6", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "summarize the food supply chain process", "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "summarize the food supply chain process", "top_k": 10, "notes": 10}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 10, "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 4, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 10, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6834858655929565}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6758204698562622}, {"citation": {"source_file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6741740703582764}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6626628637313843}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Requirements for a food traceability system in a fruit supply chain.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6536556482315063}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.6520602107048035}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 15, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.6516047716140747}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 7, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6446987390518188}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 5}, "score": 0.6421931982040405}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 6}, "score": 0.641301155090332}], "retried": false}

Global food supply chains, in particular, have been noted for these attributes, as they integrate sophisticated data management systems and contribute significantly to economic growth and food security compared to local food supply chains [1]. \n\nLocal food supply chains, while promoting proximity between producers and consumers, often involve fewer intermediaries and shorter distribution paths. However, they may lack the advanced technological integration and traceability features that global chains offer [1]. The complexity of longer supply chains can lead to challenges in maintaining transparency and traceability, which are critical for food safety [3].\n\nAs the global population is projected to increase significantly, existing food supply chains will face immense pressure to meet nutritional demands sustainably. This situation necessitates improvements in efficiency, transparency, and environmental sustainability within agri-food systems [4]. The integration of digital technologies is becoming increasingly important to optimize supply chain management and address these challenges [5].\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 6 | chunk 0\n[3] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 0\n[4] Agri-food traceability today Advancing innovation towards efficiency,.pdf | page 13 | chunk 2\n[5] Smart agri-food supply chains during the 2020s Mapping emerging trends,.pdf | page 1 | chunk 0", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "best existing food supply chain?", "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "best existing food supply chain?", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 4, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6715982556343079}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6517347693443298}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6481297612190247}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Agri-food traceability today Advancing innovation towards efficiency,.pdf", "page": 13, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6414964199066162}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Smart agri-food supply chains during the 2020s Mapping emerging trends,.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.636038601398468}], "retried": false}

Global food supply chains generally exhibit enhanced food safety measures and advanced technology integration compared to local food supply chains. However, local food supply chains are often viewed as more environmentally friendly. A comprehensive assessment is necessary to identify which country excels in these areas.\n\n## Key insights\n\nGlobal food supply chains are characterized by higher levels of food safety measures, advanced technology adoption, and greater traceability compared to local food supply chains. They also contribute significantly to economic growth and food security, making them a strong contender for the best food supply chain systems [1]. Conversely, local food supply chains are considered more environmentally sustainable, emphasizing proximity between producers and consumers, which can lead to reduced food miles and lower carbon footprints [2]. However, the complexity of global supply chains can create challenges in traceability and transparency, particularly as the number of intermediaries increases [3].\n\nThe projected global economic growth of approximately 2.9 percent annually will necessitate both local and global food supply chains to increase production to meet rising food demands [4]. This growth presents opportunities for countries to enhance their food supply chains by adopting innovative technologies and improving sustainability practices. However, inadequate data management remains a significant issue that can hinder the efficiency of food supply chains [5].\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo identify the best country for food supply chains, a detailed analysis of each country's food safety measures, technology adoption rates, and sustainability practices should be conducted. Countries should invest in advanced data management systems to improve traceability and transparency within their supply chains. Additionally, fostering collaboration between local producers and consumers can enhance the sustainability of food systems. Finally, governments and stakeholders should prioritize the integration of innovative technologies to adapt to changing market demands and improve overall food security.\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 1\n[3] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 0\n[4] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 3\n[5] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 10 | chunk 4", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "in what country is food supply chain the best?", "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "in what country is food supply chain the best?", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 7, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 1, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "query_rewriter", "action": "rewrite", "detail": "Rewrote retrieval query for retry", "meta": {"old_query": "in what country is food supply chain the best?", "new_query": "best country food supply chain performance evidence, factors, technology adoption, food safety, economic contributions"}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "retry_requested", "detail": "Missing/invalid citations; requesting one retry with rewritten query", "meta": {"new_query": "best country food supply chain performance evidence, factors, technology adoption, food safety, economic contributions"}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "best country food supply chain performance evidence, factors, technology adoption, food safety, economic contributions", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 7, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 2, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "final_with_warnings", "detail": "Finalized but some body paragraphs still missing citations", "meta": {"missing_count": 2}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.731081485748291}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.7127875089645386}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6993223428726196}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 3}, "score": 0.6895644068717957}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.6803654432296753}], "retried": true}

The case study approach allows for a deeper understanding of specific contexts, revealing unique complexities and dynamics through empirical observations and theoretical constructs [3]. In contrast, the SLR method focuses on synthesizing existing literature to establish a robust theoretical foundation, enhancing the credibility and clarity of research findings [5]. Both methods have their merits, but they serve different purposes in sustainability assessment.\n\n### Key Differences\nThe primary difference between the two approaches lies in their methodology and focus. The case study-based abductive approach emphasizes real-world complexities and iterative reasoning, making it suitable for exploring under-investigated areas [3]. It employs various data collection tools, such as interviews and observations, to gain insights into specific cases [3]. Conversely, the SLR method aggregates existing research to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic, ensuring that conclusions are consistent and reliable [5]. This approach is more suited for establishing theoretical frameworks rather than exploring specific instances.\n\n### Implications\nChoosing the case study-based abductive approach may lead to more nuanced insights into sustainability practices, as it allows for the exploration of contextual factors that influence outcomes [3]. This method can be particularly beneficial for practitioners looking to implement tailored solutions in specific supply chains. On the other hand, the SLR approach is advantageous for researchers seeking to build a solid theoretical basis for future studies and to identify gaps in the existing literature [5]. Given the need for practical applications in sustainability, the case study approach is recommended for its ability to address specific challenges and provide actionable insights.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Assessing the performance of sustainability practices in an Italian food supply chain.pdf | page 9 | chunk 0\n[2] Assessing the performance of sustainability practices in an Italian food supply chain.pdf | page 13 | chunk 4\n[3] Digitalizing traditional agri-food supply chains in developing economies A pathway to regulated sustainable governance.pdf | page 3 | chunk 6\n[4] Spherical fuzzy decision support approach to evaluate the sustainable strategies in agri-food supply chains A case study in tea supply chain.pdf | page 3 | chunk 9\n[5] Tackling food waste and loss through digitalization in the food supply.pdf | page 3 | chunk 7", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "compare two approaches described on docs and recommend only one with justification", "sections": ["Comparison summary (with citations)", "Key differences", "Implications"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "compare two approaches described on docs and recommend only one with justification", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Comparison summary (with citations)", "Key differences", "Implications"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 3, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "Assessing the performance of sustainability practices in an Italian food supply chain.pdf", "page": 9, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.40453147888183594}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Assessing the performance of sustainability practices in an Italian food supply chain.pdf", "page": 13, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.3922921419143677}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Digitalizing traditional agri-food supply chains in developing economies A pathway to regulated sustainable governance.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 6}, "score": 0.36128586530685425}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Spherical fuzzy decision support approach to evaluate the sustainable strategies in agri-food supply chains A case study in tea supply chain.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 9}, "score": 0.34215447306632996}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Tackling food waste and loss through digitalization in the food supply.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.33299779891967773}], "retried": false}

Three particularly risky decisions include the reliance on complex global supply chains, the adoption of new technologies without adequate risk assessment, and the lack of effective traceability systems. Each of these decisions can lead to increased food safety hazards and operational inefficiencies.\n\n### Key insights\n\nOne major risk in the food supply chain is the complexity associated with global supply chains. These systems often involve numerous intermediaries and longer distances, which complicate traceability and transparency, making it difficult to manage food safety effectively [4]. Additionally, the decision to adopt new technologies can be driven by market demands and budget constraints, but without thorough risk assessments, these technologies may introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities into the supply chain [4]. Furthermore, local food supply chains, while generally considered more environmentally friendly, still face unique challenges that can lead to food safety risks, highlighting the need for case-by-case assessments to evaluate sustainability and safety [2][3].\n\n### Recommendations\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with food supply chains, it is recommended that businesses prioritize the simplification of their supply chains to enhance traceability and transparency. Implementing robust risk management frameworks before adopting new technologies can help identify potential hazards and ensure that these innovations do not compromise food safety. Lastly, conducting regular assessments of both local and global supply chains will allow businesses to adapt to emerging risks and maintain high food safety standards.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf | page 2 | chunk 0\n[2] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 1\n[3] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 6\n[4] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 0\n[5] Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf | page 6 | chunk 2", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "show me 3 risky decisions on food supply chain", "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "show me 3 risky decisions on food supply chain", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 9, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 3, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "query_rewriter", "action": "rewrite", "detail": "Rewrote retrieval query for retry", "meta": {"old_query": "show me 3 risky decisions on food supply chain", "new_query": "risky decisions in food supply chain management, examples, evidence, impacts on safety and security"}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "retry_requested", "detail": "Missing/invalid citations; requesting one retry with rewritten query", "meta": {"new_query": "risky decisions in food supply chain management, examples, evidence, impacts on safety and security"}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "risky decisions in food supply chain management, examples, evidence, impacts on safety and security", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 6, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 2, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "final_with_warnings", "detail": "Finalized but some body paragraphs still missing citations", "meta": {"missing_count": 2}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.7637726664543152}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.7226443290710449}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 6}, "score": 0.7122080326080322}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.7115115523338318}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6884387731552124}], "retried": true}

One alarming aspect is the complexity and length of global food supply chains, which can hinder traceability. As the number of intermediaries increases and distances grow, ensuring the safety and quality of food becomes more difficult, raising concerns about contamination and foodborne illnesses [1]. \n\nAdditionally, the projected increase in global food demand, driven by population growth and economic expansion, places immense pressure on food supply chains. This demand could lead to unsustainable practices that compromise food safety and environmental health [3]. Inadequate data management and information inaccuracies further exacerbate these issues, resulting in inefficient supply chains that may fail to meet safety standards [3].\n\nMoreover, the reliance on advanced technologies in food supply chains, while beneficial, also introduces risks. The adoption of new technologies must be carefully managed to avoid potential failures that could disrupt food safety and security [1]. The overall lack of transparency in these complex systems can create vulnerabilities that may be exploited, leading to food fraud or contamination incidents [1].\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf (p. 2, chunk 0)\n[2] How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf (p. 10, chunk 5)\n[3] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf (p. 2, chunk 3)\n[4] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf (p. 1, chunk 2)\n[5] Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf (p. 2, chunk 0)", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "something scary about food supply chain?", "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "something scary about food supply chain?", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 4, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [{"n": 1, "file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk": 0, "score": 0.7267138957977295}, {"n": 2, "file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk": 5, "score": 0.6925268173217773}, {"n": 3, "file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk": 3, "score": 0.6899239420890808}, {"n": 4, "file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk": 2, "score": 0.6815944910049438}, {"n": 5, "file": "Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk": 0, "score": 0.6768794059753418}], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.7267138957977295}, {"citation": {"source_file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 5}, "score": 0.6925268173217773}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 3}, "score": 0.6899239420890808}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6815944910049438}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6768794059753418}], "retried": false, "latency_ms": 8002.01}

This includes farming, harvesting, processing, distributing, retailing, and ultimately consumption. The supply chain can be categorized into local food supply chains (LFSC) and global food supply chains, with LFSC typically involving fewer intermediaries and a closer relationship between producers and consumers. Global food supply chains, on the other hand, are characterized by enhanced food safety measures, advanced technology adoption, and higher levels of traceability, contributing to greater food security and economic growth [1][2].\n\n### Examples\n\nExamples of food supply chains include short food supply chains (SFSCs), which are designed to foster direct relationships between producers and consumers. Common forms of SFSCs include farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture, box schemes, local farm shops, direct internet sales, and \"pick-your-own\" farms. These systems often involve a limited number of economic operators and emphasize local economic development and social relationships [3]. In contrast, traditional food supply chains may involve multiple intermediaries and longer transportation routes, which can lead to inefficiencies [2].\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe food supply chain faces several limitations, including challenges related to transparency, traceability, and food safety. Traditional methods often struggle to provide real-time information, which can result in inefficiencies and increased risks within the supply chain. Additionally, the complexity of managing interactions between various components and processes can hinder the effective movement of goods and services from producers to consumers [2][5].", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "what is the food supply chain?", "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples (with citations)", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "what is the food supply chain?", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples (with citations)", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 6, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": false}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.7019726037979126}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.6885167360305786}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Optimizing short food supply chain logistics to lower carbon.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6725139617919922}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6696210503578186}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.662961483001709}], "retried": false, "latency_ms": 10651.69}

Global food supply chains are generally more efficient due to advanced technology, enhanced food safety measures, and sophisticated data management systems, which contribute to greater food security and economic growth [2]. In contrast, local food supply chains often emphasize sustainability by promoting shorter distances between producers and consumers, which can reduce carbon footprints and enhance community development [4]. However, local chains may face logistical challenges that can hinder their economic efficiency and environmental performance [4].\n\n### Key Differences\n\nOne of the primary differences between local and global food supply chains is their approach to traceability. Global supply chains utilize advanced technologies that allow for higher levels of traceability, making it easier to monitor food safety and quality across multiple intermediaries [2]. Conversely, local food supply chains, while promoting direct relationships between producers and consumers, may struggle with traceability due to their shorter and simpler structures, which can still be complex in terms of monitoring food movement [3]. Additionally, local supply chains often prioritize social and ethical dimensions of sustainability, whereas global chains tend to focus more on environmental and economic aspects [1].\n\n### Implications\n\nThe differences between local and global food supply chains have significant implications for policy and consumer behavior. As global food demand continues to rise, there is a pressing need for both types of supply chains to improve their sustainability practices to meet environmental challenges [1]. Policymakers may need to support local food systems to enhance community resilience and reduce carbon emissions while also ensuring that global supply chains adopt better traceability and safety measures [2].

This includes all processes from agricultural production to retail and consumption, highlighting the interconnectedness of various stakeholders such as farmers, processors, distributors, and retailers. The concept of supply chain integration is crucial, as it emphasizes the collaboration among these partners to enhance visibility and flexibility throughout the food supply chain, ultimately addressing food security concerns [1][2].\n\n### Examples\n\nAn example of a food supply chain can be seen in the transition from farm to fork, which encompasses stages such as farming, harvesting, processing, distributing, and retailing.

This technology allows warehouse managers to effectively track the duration of storage for products, facilitating better decision-making regarding inventory levels and product movement. Additionally, IoT enhances visibility and information sharing across the supply chain, which contributes to more efficient inventory management practices [1][2][3].\n\n### Steps / approach\n\nTo implement IoT in inventory management, organizations can follow several steps. First, they should equip their inventory with digital sensors that can monitor various parameters, such as temperature and humidity, to ensure product quality. Next, integrating these sensors into a centralized information system allows for real-time data collection and analysis. Organizations can then use this data to improve decision-making processes, optimize stock levels, and enhance communication between supply chain partners. Finally, continuous monitoring and adjustment based on the collected data can lead to improved operational efficiency and inventory accuracy [2][4][5].\n\n### Pitfalls / caveats\n\nDespite its advantages, the implementation of IoT in inventory management comes with certain challenges. One major concern is the complexity of integrating various heterogeneous digital devices and sensors within existing supply chain structures, which may require significant investment and adaptation. Additionally, the reliance on technology raises issues related to data security and privacy, as sensitive information may be exposed to cyber threats.

However, it is noted that digital technologies, including IoT, have the potential to significantly reduce food waste across agri-food supply chains by optimizing production, enabling dynamic pricing, and redistributing surplus food. Despite this potential, the quantifiable sustainability impacts of these technologies remain largely underexplored, indicating a gap in available data regarding specific percentages of waste reduction achieved through IoT implementations [1].\n\n### Examples\nWhile specific examples of IoT reducing food waste by a certain percentage are not provided, the sources highlight that IoT can enhance food supply chain management by improving quality and efficiency. For instance, IoT technologies can facilitate better tracking of food products, leading to reduced spoilage and waste. Additionally, the integration of IoT in agriculture is seen as a transformative force that can help address inefficiencies and food safety concerns, which are critical in minimizing food waste [2][3].\n\n### Limitations\nThe primary limitation in determining the exact percentage of food waste reduction due to IoT is the lack of comprehensive studies that quantify these impacts. Most existing literature emphasizes the potential benefits of IoT in food supply chains but does not provide specific metrics or percentages related to waste reduction. This gap suggests that further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of IoT technologies in achieving measurable reductions in food waste globally [4].", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "What is the exact percentage of global food waste reduced by IoT worldwide?", "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples (with citations)", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "What is the exact percentage of global food waste reduced by IoT worldwide?", "top_k": 5, "notes": 4}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 4, "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples (with citations)", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 3, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 4, "has_sources_appendix": false}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "Smart agri-food supply chains during the 2020s Mapping emerging trends,.pdf", "page": 9, "chunk_in_page": 3}, "score": 0.6392178535461426}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Smart food supply chain management A bibliometric and.pdf", "page": 16, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.6203831434249878}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Smart food supply chain management A bibliometric and.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.6198405623435974}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Enhancing food supply chain sustainability exploring the role of IoT.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6007195115089417}], "retried": false, "latency_ms": 8093.23}

Global supply chains are often more efficient due to advanced technology, sophisticated data management systems, and enhanced food safety measures, which contribute to greater food security and economic growth [2]. In contrast, local food supply chains (LFSC) emphasize proximity between producers and consumers, which can lead to shorter supply chains but may face logistical challenges that affect economic efficiency [4]. Sustainability assessments show that local food products are marketed as a more diverse and sustainable alternative to standardized global products, although comprehensive evaluations often overlook social and ethical dimensions [1].\n\n### Key Differences\n\nOne of the primary differences between local and global food supply chains is traceability. Global supply chains utilize advanced technologies that allow for higher levels of traceability, making it easier to monitor food safety and quality across multiple intermediaries [2]. Conversely, local supply chains may struggle with traceability due to their shorter distances and simpler control strategies, which can lead to challenges in tracking issues like cross-contamination [3]. Additionally, while LFSC can enhance local economic development and provide higher price premiums for producers, they may also encounter logistical difficulties that can undermine their environmental performance [4].\n\n### Implications\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant for consumers, producers, and policymakers. Consumers may benefit from the transparency and safety of global supply chains, but they might also miss out on the community and economic benefits associated with local food systems [2]. For producers, local supply chains can enhance bargaining power and stimulate local economies, but they must navigate logistical challenges that can affect their profitability [4]. Policymakers need to consider these dynamics when designing regulations and support systems for food supply chains, balancing the benefits of global efficiency with the sustainability and community engagement offered by local systems [1].", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "Compare local vs global food supply chains (efficiency, sustainability, traceability).", "sections": ["Comparison summary (with citations)", "Key differences (with citations)", "Implications"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "Compare local vs global food supply chains (efficiency, sustainability, traceability).", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Comparison summary (with citations)", "Key differences (with citations)", "Implications"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 6, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": false}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 3}, "score": 0.7723989486694336}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.7408078908920288}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.7048217058181763}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Optimizing short food supply chain logistics to lower carbon.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.682152271270752}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.6812651753425598}], "retried": false, "latency_ms": 10969.71}

Global food supply chains are generally more efficient due to advanced technology adoption, enhanced food safety measures, and sophisticated data management systems, which contribute to greater food security and economic growth. In contrast, local food supply chains often emphasize sustainability by promoting shorter distances between producers and consumers, which can reduce environmental impacts. However, local supply chains may struggle with efficiency due to logistical challenges and limited scale [1][2].\n\n### Key Differences\n\nOne of the primary differences between local and global food supply chains is their approach to traceability. Global supply chains utilize advanced technologies that allow for higher levels of traceability, which is crucial for monitoring food safety and quality across multiple intermediaries. In contrast, local food supply chains, while promoting direct relationships between producers and consumers, may face challenges in traceability due to their shorter and less complex structures [2][3]. Additionally, local supply chains often provide economic benefits to local communities through increased bargaining power for producers and enhanced local economic multiplier effects, whereas global chains may prioritize efficiency and cost-effectiveness [4].\n\n### Implications\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant for policymakers and stakeholders in the food industry. Emphasizing local food supply chains can enhance community development and sustainability, but it may require addressing logistical inefficiencies and improving infrastructure. On the other hand, global food supply chains can offer greater food security and efficiency, but they may also pose risks related to environmental sustainability and social equity.

This encompasses everything from agricultural production to retail, ensuring that raw materials are transformed into finished food products that reach consumers. The concept of supply chain integration is crucial, as it involves strategic collaboration among various stakeholders to enhance visibility and flexibility throughout the food supply chain, ultimately addressing food security concerns and improving efficiency [1][2].\n\n### Examples\n\nAn example of a food supply chain can be seen in the transition from farm to fork, which includes stages such as farming, harvesting, processing, distributing, and retailing.

This technology allows warehouse managers to effectively track the duration of product storage, facilitating timely decision-making regarding inventory levels and product movement. Additionally, IoT enhances visibility and information sharing across the supply chain, which contributes to improved operational efficiency and agility in inventory management [1][2][3].\n\n### Steps / approach\n\nTo implement IoT in inventory management, organizations can follow several key steps. First, they should equip their inventory with digital sensors that can monitor various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and stock levels. Next, integrating these sensors into a centralized information system will facilitate real-time data collection and analysis. Organizations can then utilize this data to enhance decision-making processes, improve tracking of inventory movements, and streamline communication between supply chain partners. Finally, continuous evaluation and adaptation of the IoT system will ensure it meets evolving business needs and enhances overall supply chain effectiveness [2][4][5].\n\n### Pitfalls / caveats\n\nDespite its advantages, the implementation of IoT in inventory management comes with potential pitfalls. One significant concern is the complexity of integrating heterogeneous digital devices and sensors within existing supply chain structures, which may lead to operational challenges. Additionally, there are risks associated with data security and privacy, as increased connectivity can expose sensitive information to cyber threats.

However, it is noted that digital technologies, including IoT, have the potential to significantly reduce food waste across agri-food supply chains by optimizing production, enabling dynamic pricing, and redistributing surplus food. Despite this potential, the quantifiable impacts of these technologies on sustainability and food waste reduction remain largely underexplored [1].\n\n### Examples\nWhile specific percentages are not provided, the sources indicate that IoT can enhance food supply chain sustainability by improving waste management practices. For instance, IoT technologies can facilitate better tracking of food products, which can lead to reduced spoilage and waste during transportation and storage. Additionally, the integration of IoT in food supply chains aligns with Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in promoting responsible consumption and production [4].\n\n### Limitations\nThe primary limitation in assessing the impact of IoT on global food waste reduction is the lack of comprehensive studies quantifying these effects.

Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of food supply chains (FSC), with many willing to pay extra for food that demonstrates a lower environmental impact if the information is clear [1]. On the other hand, the importance of knowing where food comes from and how it is produced is also a significant factor for consumers, influencing their choices in food sourcing [1].\n\n### Key Differences\nThe primary difference between these two decisions lies in their focus. Choosing to prioritize environmental impact emphasizes the sustainability of food production methods and energy use, reflecting a growing consumer trend towards eco-friendliness [1]. In contrast, prioritizing transparency focuses on the clarity of information regarding food origins and production practices, which can enhance consumer trust and informed decision-making [1]. While both aspects are important, they cater to different consumer values and motivations.\n\n### Implications\nThe implications of these decisions can significantly affect consumer behavior and market trends. If consumers prioritize environmental impact, businesses may need to adopt more sustainable practices and invest in energy-efficient technologies to meet demand [1]. Conversely, if transparency is prioritized, companies may need to improve their communication strategies and provide clear information about their sourcing practices to build trust with consumers [1].

Global food supply chains are often characterized by enhanced food safety measures, advanced technology adoption, and sophisticated data management systems, which contribute to greater food security and economic growth. In contrast, local food supply chains typically involve fewer intermediaries and a closer relationship between producers and consumers, which can promote sustainability but may face challenges in efficiency due to logistical difficulties and limited scale [1][2]. \n\n### Key Differences\n\nOne of the primary differences between local and global food supply chains is their traceability. Global supply chains, due to their complexity and the longer distances food travels, require more sophisticated traceability systems to monitor food safety and quality effectively. In contrast, local supply chains benefit from shorter distances, which can simplify traceability but may still struggle with transparency and control [2][3]. Additionally, local food supply chains can enhance community development and provide higher price premiums for producers, while global chains often leverage economies of scale to achieve lower costs [4].\n\n### Implications\n\nThe implications of these differences are significant for consumers, producers, and policymakers. Local food supply chains can foster community resilience and sustainability, but they may not always meet the growing food demand efficiently. On the other hand, global supply chains can provide a more stable food supply and economic growth but may compromise local economies and environmental sustainability.

It allows warehouse managers to effectively track the duration of storage for products, facilitating timely decision-making regarding inventory levels. Additionally, IoT enhances visibility and information sharing across the supply chain, which contributes to improved operational efficiency and agility in inventory management [1][2][3].\n\n### Steps / approach\n\nTo implement IoT in inventory management, organizations can follow several steps. First, they should equip their inventory with digital sensors that can monitor various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and stock levels. Next, integrating these sensors into a centralized information system will facilitate real-time data collection and analysis. Organizations should also focus on enhancing communication between different supply chain partners to ensure seamless information flow. Finally, leveraging the insights gained from IoT data can help in making informed decisions regarding inventory replenishment and management [2][4][5].\n\n### Pitfalls / caveats\n\nDespite its advantages, there are potential pitfalls in using IoT for inventory management. One major concern is the complexity of integrating heterogeneous digital devices and sensors into existing supply chain structures, which may lead to operational challenges. Additionally, the reliance on technology raises issues related to data security and privacy, as sensitive information may be vulnerable to breaches.
