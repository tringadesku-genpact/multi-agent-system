It aims to efficiently move food products from producers to consumers while ensuring food safety, traceability, and transparency throughout the process. Global food supply chains are noted for their enhanced food safety measures, advanced technology adoption, and sophisticated data management systems, which contribute to greater food security and economic growth compared to local food supply chains [1][3].\n\n### Examples\nAn example of a food supply chain can be seen in the confectionery industry, where blockchain technology is utilized to enhance safety and traceability. This technology allows for secure and transparent sharing of information across the supply chain, addressing challenges such as food safety and inefficiencies in traditional methods [2][3]. Additionally, local food supply chains often involve sourcing food from nearby farms, thereby reducing the number of intermediaries and fostering a direct relationship between producers and consumers [1].\n\n### Limitations\nDespite its advantages, the food supply chain faces several limitations. Traditional supply chain methods often struggle with transparency and real-time information sharing, leading to inefficiencies and risks in food safety [3]. Moreover, the complexity of managing perishable goods adds another layer of challenge, requiring advanced practices to align production with consumer demand effectively [4]. These limitations highlight the need for continuous improvement and innovation within food supply chain management.\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 6 | chunk 0\n[3] Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf | page 4 | chunk 1\n[4] A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf | page 2 | chunk 7\n[5] How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf | page 10 | chunk 0", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "summarize what is the food supply chain used for", "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "summarize what is the food supply chain used for", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Explanation (with citations)", "Examples", "Limitations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 3, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.7134829759597778}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6879408359527588}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.6763288974761963}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6756665110588074}, {"citation": {"source_file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6747821569442749}], "retried": false}

It begins with farming, where agricultural tasks are performed to grow crops or raise livestock. Following this, the harvesting phase collects the produce, which is then processed to prepare it for distribution. The distribution stage involves transporting the food to various retail outlets, where it is eventually sold to consumers for consumption [1][6].\n\nIn addition to these primary stages, the food supply chain also incorporates various activities such as planning, sourcing, and logistics management to ensure efficiency and alignment with consumer demand. Advanced technologies and data management systems are increasingly being adopted to enhance traceability and food safety throughout the supply chain [2][6]. Local food supply chains, characterized by shorter distances between producers and consumers, typically involve fewer intermediaries, promoting a direct relationship between the two [1].\n\nChallenges within the food supply chain include maintaining transparency, ensuring food safety, and managing the complexities of delivering perishable goods. The integration of technologies such as blockchain is being explored to improve traceability and reduce inefficiencies, thereby addressing some of these challenges [6][8]. Overall, the food supply chain is a complex network that requires careful orchestration of its various components to function effectively.\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf | page 2 | chunk 7\n[3] How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf | page 10 | chunk 0\n[4] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 6 | chunk 0\n[5] Requirements for a food traceability system in a fruit supply chain.pdf | page 3 | chunk 7\n[6] Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf | page 4 | chunk 1\n[7] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 15 | chunk 4\n[8] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 7 | chunk 2\n[9] Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf | page 2 | chunk 5\n[10] Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf | page 2 | chunk 6", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "summarize the food supply chain process", "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "summarize the food supply chain process", "top_k": 10, "notes": 10}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 10, "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 4, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 10, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6834858655929565}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A predictive modelling approach to decoding consumer intention for adopting energy-efficient technologies in food supply chains.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6758204698562622}, {"citation": {"source_file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6741740703582764}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6626628637313843}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Requirements for a food traceability system in a fruit supply chain.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.6536556482315063}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology in the food supply chain a way towards circular economy and sustainability.pdf", "page": 4, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.6520602107048035}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 15, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.6516047716140747}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 7, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6446987390518188}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 5}, "score": 0.6421931982040405}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Short food supply chains versus meal planning using artificial.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 6}, "score": 0.641301155090332}], "retried": false}

Global food supply chains, in particular, have been noted for these attributes, as they integrate sophisticated data management systems and contribute significantly to economic growth and food security compared to local food supply chains [1]. \n\nLocal food supply chains, while promoting proximity between producers and consumers, often involve fewer intermediaries and shorter distribution paths. However, they may lack the advanced technological integration and traceability features that global chains offer [1]. The complexity of longer supply chains can lead to challenges in maintaining transparency and traceability, which are critical for food safety [3].\n\nAs the global population is projected to increase significantly, existing food supply chains will face immense pressure to meet nutritional demands sustainably. This situation necessitates improvements in efficiency, transparency, and environmental sustainability within agri-food systems [4]. The integration of digital technologies is becoming increasingly important to optimize supply chain management and address these challenges [5].\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf | page 6 | chunk 0\n[3] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 0\n[4] Agri-food traceability today Advancing innovation towards efficiency,.pdf | page 13 | chunk 2\n[5] Smart agri-food supply chains during the 2020s Mapping emerging trends,.pdf | page 1 | chunk 0", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "best existing food supply chain?", "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "best existing food supply chain?", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 4, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6715982556343079}, {"citation": {"source_file": "A new blockchain and IoT based architecture of food safety system for confectionery supply chain in Industry 4.0 era.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6517347693443298}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6481297612190247}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Agri-food traceability today Advancing innovation towards efficiency,.pdf", "page": 13, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6414964199066162}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Smart agri-food supply chains during the 2020s Mapping emerging trends,.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.636038601398468}], "retried": false}

Global food supply chains generally exhibit enhanced food safety measures and advanced technology integration compared to local food supply chains. However, local food supply chains are often viewed as more environmentally friendly. A comprehensive assessment is necessary to identify which country excels in these areas.\n\n## Key insights\n\nGlobal food supply chains are characterized by higher levels of food safety measures, advanced technology adoption, and greater traceability compared to local food supply chains. They also contribute significantly to economic growth and food security, making them a strong contender for the best food supply chain systems [1]. Conversely, local food supply chains are considered more environmentally sustainable, emphasizing proximity between producers and consumers, which can lead to reduced food miles and lower carbon footprints [2]. However, the complexity of global supply chains can create challenges in traceability and transparency, particularly as the number of intermediaries increases [3].\n\nThe projected global economic growth of approximately 2.9 percent annually will necessitate both local and global food supply chains to increase production to meet rising food demands [4]. This growth presents opportunities for countries to enhance their food supply chains by adopting innovative technologies and improving sustainability practices. However, inadequate data management remains a significant issue that can hinder the efficiency of food supply chains [5].\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo identify the best country for food supply chains, a detailed analysis of each country's food safety measures, technology adoption rates, and sustainability practices should be conducted. Countries should invest in advanced data management systems to improve traceability and transparency within their supply chains. Additionally, fostering collaboration between local producers and consumers can enhance the sustainability of food systems. Finally, governments and stakeholders should prioritize the integration of innovative technologies to adapt to changing market demands and improve overall food security.\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 2\n[2] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 1\n[3] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 0\n[4] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 3\n[5] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 10 | chunk 4", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "in what country is food supply chain the best?", "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "in what country is food supply chain the best?", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 7, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 1, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "query_rewriter", "action": "rewrite", "detail": "Rewrote retrieval query for retry", "meta": {"old_query": "in what country is food supply chain the best?", "new_query": "best country food supply chain performance evidence, factors, technology adoption, food safety, economic contributions"}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "retry_requested", "detail": "Missing/invalid citations; requesting one retry with rewritten query", "meta": {"new_query": "best country food supply chain performance evidence, factors, technology adoption, food safety, economic contributions"}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "best country food supply chain performance evidence, factors, technology adoption, food safety, economic contributions", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 7, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 2, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "final_with_warnings", "detail": "Finalized but some body paragraphs still missing citations", "meta": {"missing_count": 2}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.731081485748291}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.7127875089645386}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6993223428726196}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 3}, "score": 0.6895644068717957}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.6803654432296753}], "retried": true}

The case study approach allows for a deeper understanding of specific contexts, revealing unique complexities and dynamics through empirical observations and theoretical constructs [3]. In contrast, the SLR method focuses on synthesizing existing literature to establish a robust theoretical foundation, enhancing the credibility and clarity of research findings [5]. Both methods have their merits, but they serve different purposes in sustainability assessment.\n\n### Key Differences\nThe primary difference between the two approaches lies in their methodology and focus. The case study-based abductive approach emphasizes real-world complexities and iterative reasoning, making it suitable for exploring under-investigated areas [3]. It employs various data collection tools, such as interviews and observations, to gain insights into specific cases [3]. Conversely, the SLR method aggregates existing research to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic, ensuring that conclusions are consistent and reliable [5]. This approach is more suited for establishing theoretical frameworks rather than exploring specific instances.\n\n### Implications\nChoosing the case study-based abductive approach may lead to more nuanced insights into sustainability practices, as it allows for the exploration of contextual factors that influence outcomes [3]. This method can be particularly beneficial for practitioners looking to implement tailored solutions in specific supply chains. On the other hand, the SLR approach is advantageous for researchers seeking to build a solid theoretical basis for future studies and to identify gaps in the existing literature [5]. Given the need for practical applications in sustainability, the case study approach is recommended for its ability to address specific challenges and provide actionable insights.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Assessing the performance of sustainability practices in an Italian food supply chain.pdf | page 9 | chunk 0\n[2] Assessing the performance of sustainability practices in an Italian food supply chain.pdf | page 13 | chunk 4\n[3] Digitalizing traditional agri-food supply chains in developing economies A pathway to regulated sustainable governance.pdf | page 3 | chunk 6\n[4] Spherical fuzzy decision support approach to evaluate the sustainable strategies in agri-food supply chains A case study in tea supply chain.pdf | page 3 | chunk 9\n[5] Tackling food waste and loss through digitalization in the food supply.pdf | page 3 | chunk 7", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "compare two approaches described on docs and recommend only one with justification", "sections": ["Comparison summary (with citations)", "Key differences", "Implications"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "compare two approaches described on docs and recommend only one with justification", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Comparison summary (with citations)", "Key differences", "Implications"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 3, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "Assessing the performance of sustainability practices in an Italian food supply chain.pdf", "page": 9, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.40453147888183594}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Assessing the performance of sustainability practices in an Italian food supply chain.pdf", "page": 13, "chunk_in_page": 4}, "score": 0.3922921419143677}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Digitalizing traditional agri-food supply chains in developing economies A pathway to regulated sustainable governance.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 6}, "score": 0.36128586530685425}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Spherical fuzzy decision support approach to evaluate the sustainable strategies in agri-food supply chains A case study in tea supply chain.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 9}, "score": 0.34215447306632996}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Tackling food waste and loss through digitalization in the food supply.pdf", "page": 3, "chunk_in_page": 7}, "score": 0.33299779891967773}], "retried": false}

Three particularly risky decisions include the reliance on complex global supply chains, the adoption of new technologies without adequate risk assessment, and the lack of effective traceability systems. Each of these decisions can lead to increased food safety hazards and operational inefficiencies.\n\n### Key insights\n\nOne major risk in the food supply chain is the complexity associated with global supply chains. These systems often involve numerous intermediaries and longer distances, which complicate traceability and transparency, making it difficult to manage food safety effectively [4]. Additionally, the decision to adopt new technologies can be driven by market demands and budget constraints, but without thorough risk assessments, these technologies may introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities into the supply chain [4]. Furthermore, local food supply chains, while generally considered more environmentally friendly, still face unique challenges that can lead to food safety risks, highlighting the need for case-by-case assessments to evaluate sustainability and safety [2][3].\n\n### Recommendations\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with food supply chains, it is recommended that businesses prioritize the simplification of their supply chains to enhance traceability and transparency. Implementing robust risk management frameworks before adopting new technologies can help identify potential hazards and ensure that these innovations do not compromise food safety. Lastly, conducting regular assessments of both local and global supply chains will allow businesses to adapt to emerging risks and maintain high food safety standards.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf | page 2 | chunk 0\n[2] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 1 | chunk 1\n[3] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 6\n[4] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf | page 2 | chunk 0\n[5] Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf | page 6 | chunk 2", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "show me 3 risky decisions on food supply chain", "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "show me 3 risky decisions on food supply chain", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 9, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 3, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "query_rewriter", "action": "rewrite", "detail": "Rewrote retrieval query for retry", "meta": {"old_query": "show me 3 risky decisions on food supply chain", "new_query": "risky decisions in food supply chain management, examples, evidence, impacts on safety and security"}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "retry_requested", "detail": "Missing/invalid citations; requesting one retry with rewritten query", "meta": {"new_query": "risky decisions in food supply chain management, examples, evidence, impacts on safety and security"}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "risky decisions in food supply chain management, examples, evidence, impacts on safety and security", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Executive brief", "Key insights (with citations)", "Recommendations"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 6, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 2, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "final_with_warnings", "detail": "Finalized but some body paragraphs still missing citations", "meta": {"missing_count": 2}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.7637726664543152}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 1}, "score": 0.7226443290710449}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 6}, "score": 0.7122080326080322}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.7115115523338318}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf", "page": 6, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6884387731552124}], "retried": true}

One alarming aspect is the complexity and length of global food supply chains, which can hinder traceability. As the number of intermediaries increases and distances grow, ensuring the safety and quality of food becomes more difficult, raising concerns about contamination and foodborne illnesses [1]. \n\nAdditionally, the projected increase in global food demand, driven by population growth and economic expansion, places immense pressure on food supply chains. This demand could lead to unsustainable practices that compromise food safety and environmental health [3]. Inadequate data management and information inaccuracies further exacerbate these issues, resulting in inefficient supply chains that may fail to meet safety standards [3].\n\nMoreover, the reliance on advanced technologies in food supply chains, while beneficial, also introduces risks. The adoption of new technologies must be carefully managed to avoid potential failures that could disrupt food safety and security [1]. The overall lack of transparency in these complex systems can create vulnerabilities that may be exploited, leading to food fraud or contamination incidents [1].\n\n### Sources\n[1] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf (p. 2, chunk 0)\n[2] How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf (p. 10, chunk 5)\n[3] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf (p. 2, chunk 3)\n[4] From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf (p. 1, chunk 2)\n[5] Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf (p. 2, chunk 0)", "trace": [{"agent": "system", "action": "start", "detail": "Starting LangGraph run", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "guardrails", "action": "check", "detail": "Checked input for safety", "meta": {}}, {"agent": "planner", "action": "plan", "detail": "Interpreted intent and planned workflow", "meta": {"tools": ["retriever", "writer", "verifier"], "steps": ["Analyze user intent and formulate retrieval query", "Use Retriever to gather evidence from documents", "Use Writer to synthesize answer from evidence", "Use Verifier to check grounding and citations"], "retrieval_query": "something scary about food supply chain?", "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "retriever", "action": "retrieve", "detail": "Retrieved notes from FAISS", "meta": {"query": "something scary about food supply chain?", "top_k": 5, "notes": 5}}, {"agent": "writer", "action": "draft", "detail": "Generated deliverable draft from notes (with Sources list appended)", "meta": {"notes_used": 5, "sections": ["Answer (with citations)"]}}, {"agent": "verifier", "action": "verify", "detail": "Checked citations and grounding (headings/conclusions ignored; Sources appendix excluded from paragraph checks)", "meta": {"paragraphs_checked": 4, "missing_citation_paragraphs": 0, "citations_in_range": true, "notes_available": 5, "has_sources_appendix": true}}, {"agent": "system", "action": "end", "detail": "Finished LangGraph run", "meta": {}}], "sources": [{"n": 1, "file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk": 0, "score": 0.7267138957977295}, {"n": 2, "file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk": 5, "score": 0.6925268173217773}, {"n": 3, "file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk": 3, "score": 0.6899239420890808}, {"n": 4, "file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk": 2, "score": 0.6815944910049438}, {"n": 5, "file": "Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk": 0, "score": 0.6768794059753418}], "notes": [{"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.7267138957977295}, {"citation": {"source_file": "How Important are Digital Technologies for Urban Food Security.pdf", "page": 10, "chunk_in_page": 5}, "score": 0.6925268173217773}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 3}, "score": 0.6899239420890808}, {"citation": {"source_file": "From farm to fork Examining the differences between local and global food.pdf", "page": 1, "chunk_in_page": 2}, "score": 0.6815944910049438}, {"citation": {"source_file": "Blockchain technology design based on food safety and halal risk analysis in.pdf", "page": 2, "chunk_in_page": 0}, "score": 0.6768794059753418}], "retried": false, "latency_ms": 8002.01}
